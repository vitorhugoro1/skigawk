/**
* The styleheets of Customizr are located in inc/assets/css. Each skin has its own stylesheet : blue.css, green.css, ...
* The current stylesheet is loaded after the main skin stylesheet.

* IMPORTANT : If you write your CSS code below, it will be deleted when you'll update the theme.
* If you want to make quick style test / changes, consider using the Custom CSS section in appearance > customize > advanced options > Custom CSS, it will persist on update since it is saved in your database.
* To make important CSS customizations, you'll want to use a child theme and add your css code in the style.css file of it.
